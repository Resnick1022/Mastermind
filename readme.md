Hello!
I made this as a project for my class. My original goal was to make a digital version of the game Mastermind and to have it be a multiplayer experience where one player creates the code and the other then tries to solve. I unfortunately ran into some time constraint issues that led me to make it single player, but it is still possible to challenge your friends and see who takes fewer guesses!~
I hope you enjoy it, and that you hvae a great day.
The instructions for the game are all layed out underneath the game itself with the help of some html code. 
I used html, css and javascript for this project
I hope to see this as just a small stepping stone and to do even better in the future.
